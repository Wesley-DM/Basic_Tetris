# Tetris Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game, built as part of my journey as an aspiring game developer. I’m slowly working towards creating my first full game, one project at a time. This Tetris project is a key step in my learning process, and I'm excited to share it with others.

## About Me:
I'm a game developer in the making, working on various small projects to improve my skills and explore different aspects of game design and programming. This Tetris game is one of the first steps in my journey, and I’m always looking to grow and learn more as I progress.

## Features:
- **Classic Tetris gameplay**: Rotate and move falling tetromino blocks to clear lines.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.
- **Simple controls**: Easy and intuitive controls to move and rotate blocks.

## How to Play:
- **Move left/right**: [W & D / LEFT & RIGHT].
- **Rotate**: [W / UP].
- **Drop**: [S / DOWM].
- **Pause**: [SPACE].

## Why I Built This:
I built this project as a way to practice basic game mechanics like object movement, collision detection, and UI design. It’s part of my learning journey to eventually create larger, more complex games. I hope to continue improving and building even more exciting projects in the future.

## What’s Next:
This is just one of the many projects I’m working on as I learn the ins and outs of game development. Stay tuned for more, as I continue to build and share my progress!
